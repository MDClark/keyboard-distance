# keyboard-distance

Measure the distance your finger would have to travel (if you were typing with just one finger) in order to type any given string. In this case, used for choosing the order of team members at standup by average distance per key jump.

Stole the idea from [Matt Parker's stand-up maths video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf2H9WZSIyw).
